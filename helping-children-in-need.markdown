No child should live alone.

Established in 1987, the SOS Children’s Villages Vietnam is committed to providing a loving home for orphaned and abandoned children, helping them to build an independent and meaningful future and contribute positively to the community. It currently has 17 branches across Vietnam.

Since its establishment, the SOS Children’s Villages Vietnam has received almost 6,000 orphans and underprivileged kids. About 2,800 of them have grown up, become independent and are living on their own.

Oftentimes, we don’t recognise how a small act of generosity can change the course of someone’s life. With as little as VND300,000 (or SGD17) per month, you can help provide food, shelter, and education for an orphan in one of 17 SOS villages across Vietnam.

As of November 2020, we have received a total of VND203,476,000 (or SGD11,830) in honour of Leonardo. Enrico has made an additional VND 86,000,000 (or SGD5,000) contribution to the fund.
