After the sudden passing of our beloved son Leonardo at the age of 7 months on October 16, 2020, we found ourselves searching for purpose and meaning in life. We then decided to turn this tragedy into a legacy.

First, we have set up Leonardo’s Smile Fund using all the cash donations at Leonardo’s memorial as well as via online transfer to support the SOS Children’s Villages Vietnam. This orphanage provides loving homes for children who can no longer live with their parents. We are also committed to making long-term contributions to the fund. Our donation could provide a safe and loving home to stay, offer an opportunity to go to school, and create a better future for underprivileged children.

Second, we will disseminate information about the cause of Leonardo’s death once it is available. It is really heart-breaking to talk about this experience again. Still, we hope by opening up about what happened, we can help other parents have a better understanding of the underlying health issues that might lead to such tragedy.

Leonardo is a great smiler. His smile can brighten up even the darkest moments in our life. You are invited to join us on this journey to bring more of his smile to this world and make it a better place.
