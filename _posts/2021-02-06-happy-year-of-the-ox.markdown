Tết (Lunar New Year) is just around the corner.
While we are celebrating the season of family reunion and gatherings, let us give you some updates on how Leonardo’s Smile, with generous support from you all, is helping disadvantaged children in Vietnam have a loving home and a warm Tet:

 - As of the end of January 2021, our fund has reached SGD22,208 (~ VND382,500,000)!

 - In addition to a monthly donation of VND3,000,000 for 10 families in Hanoi and Phu Tho villages, from January this year, we also started making an additional VND2,000,000 per month to support one more family in Thanh Hoa village. This was made possible thanks to a long-term commitment from an ex-colleague of Pinky’s.

 - A one-time donation of VND34,600,000 was sent to those villages for them to buy new clothes and food for the children ahead of Tết.

Last but not least, if you are looking for a meaningful gift for your kids, we highly recommend [“Đúng là Tết,”](https://tiki.vn/dung-la-tet-tang-kem-sticker-p46009043.html) a children’s picture book about the Vietnamese Lunar New Year traditions filled with nursery-rhythm-like poems and colorful illustrations. It was one of Leonardo’s favorite books and he always got so excited when we read it to him every morning.

Wish you health and prosperity in the Year of the Ox. May good luck follow you in every step and your house be filled with happiness. Chúc mừng năm mới!
