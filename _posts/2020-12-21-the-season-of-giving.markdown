More than any other time of the year, Christmas and New Year is when we reflect on what we have and what matters most to us. It also inspires us to give back to the community and support those in need.

In this spirit, we would like to update you that to date, Leonardo’s Smile Fund has received a total of SGD 18840. Almost 100 kids living in 10 families in the SOS Children’s Villages in Hanoi and Phu Tho Province are benefiting from the monthly donations that we initiated in November.

As the year 2020 draws to a close, we would like to take a moment to thank everyone for your overwhelming support and  generous donations, which will make a huge impact on the lives of underprivileged children in Vietnam. We are also grateful for your help in keeping Leonardo's legacy live on.

Wishing you a season filled with warm and cherished memories. May we all emerge in 2021 more resilient, empathetic, and stronger together.
