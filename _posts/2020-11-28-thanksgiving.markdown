Yesterday, we received the best Thanksgiving gift ever! One of Enrico’s ex-colleagues made a donation of SGD1,500 to Leonardo’s Smile Fund. He also shared with us that he has been involved with the SOS Children’s Village as a donor and adopter since 2005.

With his permission, we will send the money as “ang bao” (lucky money) for the kids at the SOS Children’s Village Vietnam for the upcoming Lunar New Year (Tết) in February 2021. Traditionally, Tết is the time for family gatherings when kids get new clothes and lucky money to buy school stationery. We hope this donation will make the coming Tết happier and warmer for the kids at the supported villages.

While we are searching for beauty in little things in life during this extremely challenging time, we are immensely thankful for the donations made by our relatives, friends, and colleagues, which have reached SGD16,830 or VND291,000,000.

Taking this opportunity, we would like to express our deepest appreciation to each and every of you for your contributions. Your generosity will make an immediate difference in the lives of underprivileged children in Vietnam.

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! Thank you for your continued support!
